My name is Ubaid Butt, and I am the founder of this small blog that you are currently visiting.

Iâ€™m a software engineer by profession, but I love economics, geopolitics, a bit of history, and social sciences. Yes, my interests are all over the place, but who said we have to be limited in our interests? I like to read books and also love writing, as you can see from this blog. ðŸ˜„

I am 27 years old, currently living and working in the Netherlands, originally from a small town called Sialkot in Pakistan. An interesting fact about my small city is that almost 70% of the footballs in the entire world are made and exported from Sialkot. Read more about this [here](https://www.businessinsider.com/most-of-the-worlds-soccer-balls-are-made-in-pakistan-2022-12?international=true&r=US&IR=T)

The quick summary of my life is that I lived 17 years of my life in Sialkot and then moved to the capital city, Islamabad, for my Bachelorâ€™s in Information Technology from Quaid-e-Azam University. After spending probably the best 4 years of my life there, I moved to another big city, Lahore, for my job. After spending 3 years working there for a company, I got a lifetime opportunity from a startup in the Netherlands that sponsored me to come and work for them in Amsterdam. This is how I ended up being in the Netherlands around the end of 2021 and began my journey of exploring this part of the world.

This blog is a place for me to dump my thoughts about all the topics I feel like sharing, including but not limited to career, software engineering, politics, social issues, travel, and religion.

If you have a question or you want to talk or have advice or anything, feel free to send me an email or message me on any of my social media handles. I wish you well.
