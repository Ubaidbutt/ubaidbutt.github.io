Hi, I’m Ubaid Butt, the founder of this small blog you’ve stumbled upon.

By profession, I’m a software engineer, but my interests span a wide range—economics, geopolitics, history, and social sciences. Yes, I know, it’s a bit all over the place, but who says we need to limit our curiosities? I love reading books and, as you can tell from this blog, I also have a passion for writing. 😄

I’m 27 years old, currently living and working in the Netherlands, but I’m originally from a small town called Sialkot in Pakistan. Fun fact: about 70% of the world’s footballs are manufactured and exported from Sialkot—pretty cool, right?

To sum up my journey so far: I spent the first 17 years of my life in Sialkot before moving to Islamabad to pursue a Bachelor’s in Information Technology at Quaid-e-Azam University. Those four years were some of the best of my life. After graduating, I moved to Lahore for my first job, where I spent three years. Then, in late 2021, I got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity from a startup in the Netherlands, which sponsored me to come and work in Amsterdam. That’s how I ended up here, beginning a new chapter of exploring this part of the world.

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts on topics that inspire me, including career, software engineering, politics, social issues, travel, and even religion.

If you’d like to connect, ask a question, or share advice, feel free to email me or reach out via social media. Thanks for stopping by, and I wish you all the best!
