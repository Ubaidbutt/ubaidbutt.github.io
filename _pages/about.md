## Introduction
I am Ubaid, a 27-year-old software engineer from Pakistan currently living and working in the Netherlands. I don't have many hobbies apart from ranting on Twitter about politics, reading books on geopolitics and technology, watching movies or series, and being lazy most of the time. I do get inspired and motivated every other week to become more productive, go to the gym, gain more knowledge, and start my own business. I try to do one or more of these when I have the motivation burst but still fighting to get more consistent in my efforts.
