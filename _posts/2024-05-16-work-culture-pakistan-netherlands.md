Work culture in south Asian countries like Pakistan varies completely 360 degree from countries in EU like the Netherlands. If you are someone from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, you would be able to relate with it much better but I am sure that even Eastern European countries like Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia & others have a significantly different work culture from that of the Netherlands and Germany.

I am going to share some of my experience of working in Pakistan and compare it to how it differs from working in the Netherlands.

## Time off / Vacation / Sick days:
In Pakistan, I had 15 days of holidays per year including my sick leaves, paternity, maternity and everything else. Other companies offered 25 days per year but most of them included your sick leaves in it. When I started working in the Netherlands, I got 25 vacation days per year and I was very happy with it. 

During the covid time, I got sick and was very sick for a few days. However, I didn’t want to use my holidays sitting alone in my apartment so I worked during those days while my manager and teammates kept asking me to take a break and get rest. I was kind of pissed thinking why are they pushing me to waste my vacation days. I only got to know it later when I sent my days off request to my manager that employees have separate sick leaves and they are not included in our 25 vacation days. You can take as many sick days as you want (a week without doctor’s prescription) and after that you need doctor’s approval but you can take months off as sick leaves and all fully paid. 

This was my first encounter that made me realise the huge difference between employee rights in Pakistan and the Netherlands.

Every company in the Netherlands is obliged to give minimum 25 vacation days per year even though most companies give 28. Every employee is paid their full salary for the first year when they are sick and 75% of their salary for the second year. All companies offer paternity and maternity leaves. For mothers, pregnancy and maternity leaves are minimum 4 months. There are good number of paternity leaves available for the father too. Most of the companies offer compassionate leaves in case of death of a closed one.

## ork pressure / Over time:
I have worked for three years so far in the Netherlands, in three different companies, and not once have I worked after 5 PM or on the weekend. Compared to Pakistan, where I was almost always working late hours to compensate for clients in the US, and working on the weekend was also a common occurrence every other month.

People in the Netherlands don’t easily accept working late hours, so even if you offer them extra money, they will not agree to work on the weekend because they value their personal time greatly. Companies are obligated to pay employees overtime if they want them to work late hours or on the weekend, and the rate for working on the weekend is almost 1.5 to 2.0 times the normal rate for employees.


## Conclusive notes:
If you come from a country like Pakistan or India, the work culture here will be much better because you are accustomed to a very high-stress, employer-oriented culture with little to no regard for employee well-being. The Netherlands is completely different, where employee rights and their well-being are paramount, and government laws ensure that.

P.S This does not mean that the Netherlands don’t have companies with toxic work culture but my comparison is first based on my personal experience and also gives you a general idea.
