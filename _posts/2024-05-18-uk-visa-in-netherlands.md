title: "Navigating the Journey: Obtaining a UK Tourist Visa from the Netherlands as a Non-EU Resident"
categories: [travel]
---

If you are from a non-EU country like Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, etc., and living in the Netherlands on a temporary residence permit, and you want to travel to the UK, you will need a visa. The process is very straightforward, but I still couldn't find clarity; hence, I am writing this article. Maybe it will help someone out there.

## Introduction 
The UK visa application from the Netherlands can be divided into two major steps:
- Submit an online application for a visitor visa on the UK government’s website by paying a fee
- Provide your supporting documents and your biometrics to a partnering company like TLS

## Step1: Apply on the UK government's portal
Go to this [website link](https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor/apply-standard-visitor-visa), scroll down, and click on the “Apply now” button to start the process. Choose your language, country of residence, and where you will provide the biometrics (Netherlands). It will then ask for your email and allow you to set up a password. This creates an account with your email so you can return to your application later if you leave it midway.

### Fill out the application form
The application form involves filling in a lot of information, such as your name, passport number, addresses (for the last 2 years), travel history, your parents' information, and more. Just provide all the information to the best of your ability.

### Pay the fee Download the checklist document and 
At the last step, download the documents checklist that you need to provide later, verify that you have provided all the information correctly, and submit the application. You will need to pay the visa fee of around 115 pounds (for a 6-month visa) at the time of writing this article.

This complete the first step in the two step process I mentioned at the start.

## Step2: Provide biometrics and documents to TLS
After you have submitted the application, you need to connect with a third-party service provider like TLS to provide your biometrics for the visa. In the last step of the previous process, there will be a button to go to the TLS website directly from the portal.

On the TLS website, you need to choose an appointment time to provide your documents and biometrics in a city close to you.

P.S. Please note that the user interface of the TLS website is terrible, so you need to pay close attention. They provide different services like the normal self-service, assisted service, passport delivery by courier, etc., but you need at least the self-service visa appointment to provide your documents and biometrics.

### Find an appointment slot
Spend some time on the portal to find and book an available slot on a given date and time. The regular self-service slots are limited and often booked in advance by others, so you won’t find many for the current week or next. You will likely have to find one a few weeks out, but if you find one earlier, book it according to your availability.

Once you have booked your appointment, you will see an overview like the following:

If you chose a self-service, there will be an extra option called "upload" after the "track" option. I chose self-service hence you don't see that for my application.

### Upload your scanned documents
You can always book premium slots and add extra services by paying additional fees. However, if you choose the bare minimum self-service, you will need to pay around 90 euros. Once you have booked your appointment and paid, you will need to upload your scanned documents on the portal before your appointment.

Your documents include mainly your passport and residence permit, as well as all the supporting documents such as salary slips, bank statements, employment contract, and sponsorship letter. The rule is to provide as many documents as you can to help them make a positive decision on your visa application.

### Visit the TLS office to provide your biometrics
After you have uploaded your scanned documents, you need to go to the TLS office at the specified time and date to provide your biometrics. It is a good idea to take copies of your documents with you.

The TLS office will take your biometrics and keep your passport. They will send you an email after 3-4 weeks, depending on when the decision is made about your visa application. If you are accepted or rejected, you can go and collect your passport from the office without booking any further appointments.

### Extra services at a cost
During the TLS appointment booking process, you can take extra services by paying an extra fee. For example, you can book an appointment for assisted services, which means that you won’t have to upload your documents yourself on the portal, but you can take your documents with you on the day of the appointment, and they will scan and upload them for you. You can also choose not to give them your passport and instead keep it with you. Once your visa is approved, you can go and have it stamped. Alternatively, you can give them your passport but have them courier it back to your address when the visa is approved instead of going and collecting it yourself. All these services, of course, come at an extra cost, which you will be able to see on the TLS portal when you are booking your appointment.

## Conclusion
If you are reading it a bit late in the future, the link to the UK portal might change, visa fee may change or the TLS website experience may change but the overall process and information will still be valid.

Good luck applying for the visa!
