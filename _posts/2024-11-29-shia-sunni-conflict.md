The Shia-Sunni divide has been a centuries-long conflict or division among Muslims, dating back to the time of the Prophet Muhammad's death. Over the years, this conflict has grown and evolved into a regional issue, exacerbated by proxy wars involving Iran and Saudi Arabia. However, if you come from Pakistan, you would understand how deeply entrenched this division is in our society. Personally, I have witnessed family members expressing hatred and labeling Shia Muslims as Kafir. Although I cannot recall the events myself, my mother has recounted stories of actual fights between groups from the Shia and Wahhabi sects in our neighborhood during the early 2000s when I was a kid. Even to this day, we see sectarian fights and the deaths of countless people because of this conflict in Pakistan.

After developing an interest in understanding Islam recently and witnessing all these Shia-Sunni arguments on Twitter in the month of Muharram, I decided to look into this conflict to make sense of it — not at a research level, but at least enough to form an educated opinion on the matter that divides millions of people worldwide.

I am sharing my understanding and perspective on the history of this conflict and my conclusions after doing my own limited research, so please take it with a pinch of salt.

The first thing we need to understand is that the conflict itself is not about Islam, as it literally began after the death of the Prophet, implying that both sides genuinely believe in the Holy Book (Quran) and the teachings of the Prophet (Sunnah & Ahadees), which are the fundamental basis for being a Muslim.

If both parties agree on the fundamentals of Islam, where does the divide come from? The basis of this divide lies in the understanding or belief about who was the rightful candidate to lead the Muslims after the death of the Prophet. Who was the rightful heir to the Muslim Ummah after the Prophet? One of the important points in this conflict is an incident that occurred shortly before the Prophet's death when he was ill. The crux of the incident is that the Prophet asked for a pen and paper, likely to write his final statement, but was prevented by Hazrat Umar and Hazrat Abu Bakr. Read more about the details of the incident [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_of_pen_and_paper#:~:text=The%20hadith%20of%20pen%20and%20paper%20%28Arabic%3A%20%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AB,a%20Thursday%2C%20but%20was%20prevented%20from%20doing%20so.). Shia believe that the Prophet wanted to name Hazrat Ali as his successor but was prevented, whereas Sunni believe that the actions of Hazrat Umar and Hazrat Abu Bakr were out of care for the Prophet, as they did not want him to endure further suffering and assured him that they had the guidance of his book.

I personally feel that I cannot question the intentions of the Prophet's wives and his most beloved companions by claiming they prevented him from naming Hazrat Ali, as there is no solid evidence to prove that this is what the Prophet intended to do at that moment. Perhaps he wanted to write something for his daughter, his wives, or maybe even to name Hazrat Umar or Hazrat Abu Bakr. The reality is that the Prophet passed away without explicitly naming his successor, and both parties derive their interpretations from this incident.

Another very important incident often cited by Shia to support the claim that the Prophet intended for Hazrat Ali to succeed him is the event of Ghadeer-e-Khum. After completing the last pilgrimage in Mecca, while the Prophet was returning to Medina, he encountered people from Hazrat Ali's caravan coming from Yemen. It was at this point that the Prophet delivered a sermon and famously said, "من كنت مولاه فهذا على مولاه," which translates to something like, "He whose mawla I am, Ali is his mawla." The term mawla is interpreted in various ways, such as friend, leader, or master. Shia use this narration as evidence that the Prophet intended for Hazrat Ali to succeed him.

However, the reality is that if this was indeed the Prophet's intent, he could have made this declaration during his last famous pilgrimage in Mecca, but he did not. The fact remains that there was never an explicit order of succession given by the Prophet.

After the death of the Prophet, everyone was, understandably, in a state of mourning. Hazrat Ali and some other family members began preparing for the final rituals, while a discussion (shura) was convened in Medina to decide the Prophet's successor. Hazrat Umar, Hazrat Abu Bakr, and some other companions attended this meeting. There were suggestions to have different rulers for Mecca and Medina, but many people preferred a single leader for the entire Muslim Ummah. The discussion lasted nearly a full day, and as tensions began to rise, Hazrat Umar took the initiative and pledged allegiance to Hazrat Abu Bakr as his leader. The people of Mecca and Medina followed suit and pledged allegiance (Bay'ah) to Hazrat Abu Bakr.

Hazrat Ali was not present at this gathering, as he was occupied with the Prophet's burial ceremony. It is also said that many were not happy with Hazrat Abu Bakr being chosen as the successor. Hazrat Ali did not give his pledge of allegiance (Bay'ah) for nearly six months, but later, after some reconciliation with Hazrat Abu Bakr, he did take the oath. This event, known as the Incident of Saqifah, is one of the most controversial moments following the Prophet's death, as Shia believe that Hazrat Abu Bakr was wrongly appointed and that the leadership should have gone to Hazrat Ali. There are numerous videos and content available online from different scholars discussing this incident if you wish to explore it further, but the overall summary is likely to remain consistent.

Hazrat Abu Bakr ruled for approximately 2 years and 3 months before his passing and appointed Hazrat Umar as his successor. Once again, this is something that Shia believe was wrong, asserting that the position should have gone to Hazrat Ali. According to authentic narrations, Hazrat Abu Bakr consulted with many of the Sahaba at the time, excluding Hazrat Umar from the discussions, before appointing him as the next caliph.

Was it the right decision? Can we question the intentions of Hazrat Abu Bakr? Personally, I cannot. As the ruler, he had the authority to appoint anyone he deemed suitable, and he made the decision he believed was in the best interest of the Muslim community. Disagreements are, of course, natural, and this is where the Shia perspective arises, as they firmly believe that the leadership should have been given to Hazrat Ali from the very beginning.

Hazrat Umar ruled for 10 and a half years before his assassination. During his tenure, Hazrat Ali worked closely with him, advising on legal and judicial matters. It is also noteworthy that when Hazrat Umar traveled to foreign territories, he often appointed Hazrat Ali as his deputy. While there may be disagreements about their relationship, especially from the Shia perspective, most authentic narrations indicate that Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Umar shared a strong relationship based on mutual respect and cooperation.

Hazrat Umar did not name a successor, as he wanted to follow the Sunnah, since the Prophet also did not appoint a successor. Instead, Hazrat Umar created a council of six people, including Hazrat Ali, Hazrat Usman, and four others, to decide on the next caliph after his death. Ultimately, Hazrat Usman was chosen from among the six to be the next Caliph of the Muslims. Once again, this is something the Shia disagree with, as they believe that the leadership should have always been given to Hazrat Ali from the beginning. Nevertheless, Hazrat Ali harbored no resentment and was, in fact, among the first to pledge his allegiance (Bay'ah) to Hazrat Usman.

Hazrat Usman ruled for 12 years, with his tenure divided into two distinct phases. The first six years were marked by peace, prosperity, the expansion of Islam, and significant economic growth. In contrast, the last six years were characterized by allegations of nepotism, rebellions, and civil unrest. Hazrat Ali played an important role during this time, serving as a legal advisor and mediator, working to ensure Hazrat Usman's safety amid the growing tensions.

Hazrat Usman was ultimately assassinated when a rebellious group laid siege to his house in a standoff that lasted for weeks. The rebels, demanding his resignation over issues of administration and governance, eventually broke into his home and killed him. It is important to note that serious allegations of nepotism led to instances of poor governance by some of Hazrat Usman's relatives, sparking widespread protests against his leadership, which even involved several Sahaba. While the exact identity of those who murdered Hazrat Usman remains unclear, the rebellion against him was fueled and, to some extent, supported by a number of Sahaba as well.

After the death of Hazrat Usman, Hazrat Ali became the Caliph, and even the rebellious group responsible for Hazrat Usman's murder pledged their allegiance (Bay'ah) to him. This decision, however, became controversial as two prominent figures—Hazrat Ayesha and Hazrat Muawiyah, the governor of Syria at the time—refused to pledge Bay'ah to Hazrat Ali. They demanded Qisas (retribution or the death penalty) for the murderers of Hazrat Usman.

Shia scholars argue that the demand for Qisas was merely a political tool, suggesting that Hazrat Muawiyah's true motive was a desire for power, while Hazrat Ayesha supported him due to past disagreements with Hazrat Ali. It is also worth noting that some historians believe Hazrat Ali's Bay'ah was influenced by coercion. This view arises from the fact that the rebellious group who had killed the previous Caliph (Hazrat Usman) were present and pledged Bay'ah to Hazrat Ali, raising concerns about the complete freedom of the allegiance under such circumstances.

I personally feel that Hazrat Ayesha and Hazrat Muawiyah had a reasonable difference of opinion, as it does appear controversial when a group responsible for killing the current ruler supports the appointment of the next ruler without the application of Qisas (retribution), which was a recognized judicial practice for murder at the time.

Nevertheless, this political disagreement escalated into a full-fledged civil war. Hazrat Muawiyah refused to relinquish his position as governor of Syria and did not acknowledge Hazrat Ali as the Caliph. This internal division among Muslims marked the beginning of the Islamic civil war.

One of the first battles in this conflict was the Battle of Jamal, fought between Hazrat Ayesha, Talha, and Zubair on one side and Hazrat Ali on the other. The battle ended in victory for Hazrat Ali, with the deaths of Talha and Zubair, while Hazrat Ayesha was captured but treated with great respect and later escorted back to Medina.

The next major battle, known as the Battle of Siffin, was fought between Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Muawiyah. Although Hazrat Ali was close to victory, the opposing forces raised Qurans on their lances, calling for arbitration based on the Quran, which led to a halt in the fighting and an agreement. However, this arbitration failed to produce a clear resolution and instead caused dissent within Hazrat Ali’s camp.

A group within Hazrat Ali’s followers strongly opposed the arbitration, deeming it un-Islamic. This faction, later known as the Khawarij, rebelled against Hazrat Ali, leading to the Battle of Nahrawan. In this battle, Hazrat Ali defeated the Khawarij, nearly annihilating them, though a few survivors continued their opposition and caused trouble later.

While Hazrat Ali emerged victorious in these battles, the ongoing civil unrest and internal strife weakened his position, allowing Hazrat Muawiyah to consolidate his power in Syria and strengthen his claim to leadership.
