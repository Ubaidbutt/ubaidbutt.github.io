## Introduction test
The Shia-Sunni divide has been a centuries-long conflict or division among Muslims, dating back to the time of the Prophet Muhammad's death. Over the years, this conflict has grown and evolved into a regional issue, exacerbated by proxy wars involving Iran and Saudi Arabia. However, if you come from Pakistan, you would understand how deeply entrenched this division is in our society. Personally, I have witnessed family members expressing hatred and labeling Shia Muslims as Kafir. Although I cannot recall the events myself, my mother has recounted stories of actual fights between groups from the Shia and Wahhabi sects in our neighborhood during the early 2000s when I was a kid. Even to this day, we see sectarian fights and the deaths of countless people because of this conflict in Pakistan.

After developing an interest in understanding Islam recently and witnessing all these Shia-Sunni arguments on Twitter in the month of Muharram, I decided to look into this conflict to make sense of it — not at a research level, but at least enough to form an educated opinion on the matter that divides millions of people worldwide.

I am sharing my understanding and perspective on the history of this conflict and my conclusions after doing my own limited research, so please take it with a pinch of salt.

## High level background of the conflict
The first thing we need to understand is that the conflict itself is not about Islam, as it literally began after the death of the Prophet, implying that both sides genuinely believe in the Holy Book (Quran) and the teachings of the Prophet (Sunnah & Ahadees), which are the fundamental basis for being a Muslim.

If both parties agree on the fundamentals of Islam, where does the divide come from? The basis of this divide lies in the understanding or belief about who was the rightful candidate to lead the Muslims after the death of the Prophet. Who was the rightful heir to the Muslim Ummah after the Prophet? One of the important points in this conflict is an incident that occurred shortly before the Prophet's death when he was ill. The crux of the incident is that the Prophet asked for a pen and paper, likely to write his final statement, but was prevented by Hazrat Umar and Hazrat Abu Bakr. Read more about the details of the incident [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith_of_pen_and_paper#:~:text=The%20hadith%20of%20pen%20and%20paper%20%28Arabic%3A%20%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AB,a%20Thursday%2C%20but%20was%20prevented%20from%20doing%20so.). Shia believe that the Prophet wanted to name Hazrat Ali as his successor but was prevented, whereas Sunni believe that the actions of Hazrat Umar and Hazrat Abu Bakr were out of care for the Prophet, as they did not want him to endure further suffering and assured him that they had the guidance of his book.

I personally feel that I cannot question the intentions of the Prophet's wives and his most beloved companions by claiming they prevented him from naming Hazrat Ali, as there is no solid evidence to prove that this is what the Prophet intended to do at that moment. Perhaps he wanted to write something for his daughter, his wives, or maybe even to name Hazrat Umar or Hazrat Abu Bakr. The reality is that the Prophet passed away without explicitly naming his successor, and both parties derive their interpretations from this incident.

Another very important incident often cited by Shia to support the claim that the Prophet intended for Hazrat Ali to succeed him is the event of Ghadeer-e-Khum. After completing the last pilgrimage in Mecca, while the Prophet was returning to Medina, he encountered people from Hazrat Ali's caravan coming from Yemen. It was at this point that the Prophet delivered a sermon and famously said, "من كنت مولاه فهذا على مولاه," which translates to something like, "He whose mawla I am, Ali is his mawla." The term mawla is interpreted in various ways, such as friend, leader, or master. Shia use this narration as evidence that the Prophet intended for Hazrat Ali to succeed him.

However, the reality is that if this was indeed the Prophet's intent, he could have made this declaration during his last famous pilgrimage in Mecca, but he did not. The fact remains that there was never an explicit order of succession given by the Prophet.

After the death of the Prophet, everyone was, understandably, in a state of mourning. Hazrat Ali and some other family members began preparing for the final rituals, while a discussion (shura) was convened in Medina to decide the Prophet's successor. Hazrat Umar, Hazrat Abu Bakr, and some other companions attended this meeting. There were suggestions to have different rulers for Mecca and Medina, but many people preferred a single leader for the entire Muslim Ummah. The discussion lasted nearly a full day, and as tensions began to rise, Hazrat Umar took the initiative and pledged allegiance to Hazrat Abu Bakr as his leader. The people of Mecca and Medina followed suit and pledged allegiance (Bay'ah) to Hazrat Abu Bakr.

Hazrat Ali was not present at this gathering, as he was occupied with the Prophet's burial ceremony. It is also said that many were not happy with Hazrat Abu Bakr being chosen as the successor. Hazrat Ali did not give his pledge of allegiance (Bay'ah) for nearly six months, but later, after some reconciliation with Hazrat Abu Bakr, he did take the oath. This event, known as the Incident of Saqifah, is one of the most controversial moments following the Prophet's death, as Shia believe that Hazrat Abu Bakr was wrongly appointed and that the leadership should have gone to Hazrat Ali. There are numerous videos and content available online from different scholars discussing this incident if you wish to explore it further, but the overall summary is likely to remain consistent.

Hazrat Abu Bakr ruled for approximately 2 years and 3 months before his passing and appointed Hazrat Umar as his successor. Once again, this is something that Shia believe was wrong, asserting that the position should have gone to Hazrat Ali. According to authentic narrations, Hazrat Abu Bakr consulted with many of the Sahaba at the time, excluding Hazrat Umar from the discussions, before appointing him as the next caliph.

Was it the right decision? Can we question the intentions of Hazrat Abu Bakr? Personally, I cannot. As the ruler, he had the authority to appoint anyone he deemed suitable, and he made the decision he believed was in the best interest of the Muslim community. Disagreements are, of course, natural, and this is where the Shia perspective arises, as they firmly believe that the leadership should have been given to Hazrat Ali from the very beginning.

Hazrat Umar ruled for 10 and a half years before his assassination. During his tenure, Hazrat Ali worked closely with him, advising on legal and judicial matters. It is also noteworthy that when Hazrat Umar traveled to foreign territories, he often appointed Hazrat Ali as his deputy. While there may be disagreements about their relationship, especially from the Shia perspective, most authentic narrations indicate that Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Umar shared a strong relationship based on mutual respect and cooperation.

Hazrat Umar did not name a successor, as he wanted to follow the Sunnah, since the Prophet also did not appoint a successor. Instead, Hazrat Umar created a council of six people, including Hazrat Ali, Hazrat Usman, and four others, to decide on the next caliph after his death. Ultimately, Hazrat Usman was chosen from among the six to be the next Caliph of the Muslims. Once again, this is something the Shia disagree with, as they believe that the leadership should have always been given to Hazrat Ali from the beginning. Nevertheless, Hazrat Ali harbored no resentment and was, in fact, among the first to pledge his allegiance (Bay'ah) to Hazrat Usman.

Hazrat Usman ruled for 12 years, with his tenure divided into two distinct phases. The first six years were marked by peace, prosperity, the expansion of Islam, and significant economic growth. In contrast, the last six years were characterized by allegations of nepotism, rebellions, and civil unrest. Hazrat Ali played an important role during this time, serving as a legal advisor and mediator, working to ensure Hazrat Usman's safety amid the growing tensions.

Hazrat Usman was ultimately assassinated when a rebellious group laid siege to his house in a standoff that lasted for weeks. The rebels, demanding his resignation over issues of administration and governance, eventually broke into his home and killed him. It is important to note that serious allegations of nepotism led to instances of poor governance by some of Hazrat Usman's relatives, sparking widespread protests against his leadership, which even involved several Sahaba. While the exact identity of those who murdered Hazrat Usman remains unclear, the rebellion against him was fueled and, to some extent, supported by a number of Sahaba as well.

After the death of Hazrat Usman, Hazrat Ali became the Caliph, and even the rebellious group responsible for Hazrat Usman's murder pledged their allegiance (Bay'ah) to him. This decision, however, became controversial as two prominent figures—Hazrat Ayesha and Hazrat Muawiyah, the governor of Syria at the time—refused to pledge Bay'ah to Hazrat Ali. They demanded Qisas (retribution or the death penalty) for the murderers of Hazrat Usman.

Shia scholars argue that the demand for Qisas was merely a political tool, suggesting that Hazrat Muawiyah's true motive was a desire for power, while Hazrat Ayesha supported him due to past disagreements with Hazrat Ali. It is also worth noting that some historians believe Hazrat Ali's Bay'ah was influenced by coercion. This view arises from the fact that the rebellious group who had killed the previous Caliph (Hazrat Usman) were present and pledged Bay'ah to Hazrat Ali, raising concerns about the complete freedom of the allegiance under such circumstances.

I personally feel that Hazrat Ayesha and Hazrat Muawiyah had a reasonable difference of opinion, as it does appear controversial when a group responsible for killing the current ruler supports the appointment of the next ruler without the application of Qisas (retribution), which was a recognized judicial practice for murder at the time.

Nevertheless, this political disagreement escalated into a full-fledged civil war. Hazrat Muawiyah refused to relinquish his position as governor of Syria and did not acknowledge Hazrat Ali as the Caliph. This internal division among Muslims marked the beginning of the Islamic civil war.

One of the first battles in this conflict was the Battle of Jamal, fought between Hazrat Ayesha, Talha, and Zubair on one side and Hazrat Ali on the other. The battle ended in victory for Hazrat Ali, with the deaths of Talha and Zubair, while Hazrat Ayesha was captured but treated with great respect and later escorted back to Medina.

The next major battle, known as the Battle of Siffin, was fought between Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Muawiyah. Although Hazrat Ali was close to victory, the opposing forces raised Qurans on their lances, calling for arbitration based on the Quran, which led to a halt in the fighting and an agreement. However, this arbitration failed to produce a clear resolution and instead caused dissent within Hazrat Ali’s camp.

A group within Hazrat Ali’s followers strongly opposed the arbitration, deeming it un-Islamic. This faction, later known as the Khawarij, rebelled against Hazrat Ali, leading to the Battle of Nahrawan. In this battle, Hazrat Ali defeated the Khawariji, nearly annihilating them, though a few survivors continued their opposition and caused trouble later.

While Hazrat Ali emerged victorious in these battles, the ongoing civil unrest and internal strife weakened his position, allowing Hazrat Muawiyah to consolidate his power in Syria and strengthen his claim to leadership.

After ruling for approximately 4 years and 9 months, Hazrat Ali was assassinated by a member of the Khawarij while leading prayers in a mosque in Kufa. The death of Hazrat Ali was likely the final nail in the coffin of an already deteriorating relationship between Shia and Sunni, further deepening the divide between the two sects.

After the death of Hazrat Ali, his eldest son, Hazrat Hasan, briefly became the Caliph for about six months amidst ongoing civil unrest and conflict with Hazrat Muawiyah. To prevent further bloodshed, Hazrat Hasan negotiated a peace treaty with Hazrat Muawiyah under specific conditions and formally pledged allegiance to him, making Hazrat Muawiyah the Caliph. However, traditionally, only the first four Caliphs are regarded as the Rashidun Caliphs (Rightly Guided Caliphs), while Hazrat Muawiyah’s rule marked the beginning of the Umayyad Caliphate, which later introduced a dynastic system of leadership.

Hazrat Muawiyah ruled for nearly 20 years, and his reign is generally considered prosperous in terms of administrative reforms, maintaining law and order, and expanding the Islamic empire. However, his introduction of dynastic politics by appointing his son Yazid as his successor, along with his historical conflicts with the Ahlul Bayt (Hazrat Ali and his sons), has made him a controversial figure in Islamic sectarian history.

Before discussing the death of Hazrat Muawiyah, it is important to mention another widely debated incident that clearly divides Shia and Sunni perspectives: the death of Hazrat Hasan, who had signed the peace treaty with Hazrat Muawiyah. Hazrat Hasan died nine years into Hazrat Muawiyah's rule, with Shia and some neutral sources suggesting that he was poisoned for political motives. Sunni accounts also acknowledge the poisoning narrative but avoid direct accusations, suggesting it could have been an individual's act or even natural causes.

Hazrat Muawiyah passed away after a 20-year rule and appointed his son Yazid as the next Caliph, officially establishing dynastic leadership in the Umayyad Caliphate. Upon assuming power, Yazid sought allegiance (Bay'ah) from Hazrat Hussain, the brother of Hazrat Hasan and the younger son of Hazrat Ali. However, Hazrat Hussain refused to pledge allegiance, as this violated the terms of the peace treaty signed between Hazrat Muawiyah and Hazrat Hasan, which stipulated that Hazrat Muawiyah would not appoint a successor and would allow the Muslims to choose their ruler. Hazrat Hussain’s refusal to pledge allegiance to Yazid set the stage for one of the most significant events in Shia history: the Tragedy of Karbala.

After becoming the ruler, Yazid sought allegiance from key figures in the Prophet's family, including Hazrat Hussain. However, Hazrat Hussain refused to pledge allegiance, as Yazid's appointment violated the peace treaty signed with Hazrat Hasan, and he considered Yazid's rule contrary to Islamic principles. While Hazrat Hussain was in Mecca, the people of Kufa sent numerous letters urging him to come and lead a rebellion against Yazid. In response, Hazrat Hussain, along with his family and a small group of companions, began his journey toward Kufa.

Meanwhile, Yazid's governor in Kufa had suppressed the uprising by killing many of the city's Muslims. Yazid's army intercepted Hazrat Hussain's caravan at Karbala, surrounding them and cutting off access to water and essential supplies for ten days. This siege, marked by unimaginable suffering for Hazrat Hussain's family, including women and children, culminated in Hazrat Hussain's decision to fight Yazid's army rather than pledge allegiance. The battle resulted in the martyrdom of 72 individuals, while the women and children were taken captive.

The tragedy of Karbala remains one of the most discussed and documented events in Islamic history. Extensive resources and analysis, particularly from Shia scholars and historians, are available for those seeking to learn more about this pivotal incident.

The post-Karbala history, including the rule of Yazid and his successors, is certainly worth discussing, but the tragedy of Karbala stands as the pivotal moment where the division between Shia and Sunni began to deepen—a division that has grown over centuries. If you wish to explore this in greater detail, it's important to delve into the individual events and incidents of these 50 years, as this period is so rich in complexity and significance that one could dedicate multiple PhDs to studying it. With that, I’ll leave it here.

## Conclusive remarks
I would like to conclude by reiterating what I mentioned at the beginning: the Shia-Sunni conflict and division started after the death of the Prophet and stemmed from the political events that followed. It’s important to note that understanding this conflict on a deeper level requires studying the 50 years of history following the Prophet’s passing, along with the context and nuances of that time. This includes analyzing the reign of each of the Rashidun Caliphs, the roles of the Sahaba, and the socio-political environment of the period.

Additionally, one must also consider the Ahadees where the Prophet foretold events that would occur after his death. To gain a comprehensive understanding, it’s essential to study this history from both Shia and Sunni perspectives, along with their respective references. Even then, it may be difficult to arrive at an objective conclusion about which side was right in this historical division. I say this because history should always be approached with caution, as it is not like the Quran, which has been promised protection by God Himself.

However, the good news is that as a Muslim, you don’t need to choose a side to practice your faith. Being a Muslim is not dependent on the politics that unfolded after the Prophet’s death. If you believe in the Quran, the Prophet, and his teachings, that is sufficient to guide you both in this life and the hereafter.

It’s natural to have opinions on the historical events of Islamic history, such as believing Hazrat Muawiyah was wrong in his conflict with Hazrat Ali, thinking Hazrat Ali should have been the first Caliph, or questioning the circumstances of Hazrat Ali’s appointment as Caliph in the presence of Hazrat Usman’s killers. Such opinions are valid as long as they are expressed respectfully, especially towards the Sahaba who lived, supported, and fought alongside the Prophet.

What makes this conflict so dangerous is the tendency of people to take extreme sides based on their political or sectarian views. Some from the Sunni sect label Shia as Kafir (non-Muslims), while some Shia express extreme disrespect, even to the point of abusing figures like the first three Caliphs and Hazrat Ayesha. While this may not render them Kafir, it undoubtedly fuels hatred and division, especially since these individuals are deeply respected in the Sunni community.

## My personal perspective 
You’ve read this long blog all the way to the end, so I believe you deserve my honest personal take on this matter. Below is my unfiltered view on the Shia-Sunni conflict, based on my limited understanding:

- I strongly believe that there is absolutely no conclusive evidence to prove that the Prophet explicitly wanted Hazrat Ali to succeed him. Shia often cite various Ahadees and narrations, such as those from Ghadir Khumm, to support the idea that Hazrat Ali should have been the successor, but none of these provide definitive proof of such a claim. The Prophet left this world without naming a successor, and for Shia to assert otherwise or attempt to convince themselves or others of this is simply incorrect.
- Based on the history derived from widely accepted narrations and authentic Ahadees about Hazrat Umar and Hazrat Abu Bakr, I find it extremely difficult to question their intentions or accuse them of being power-hungry and deliberately taking the succession away from Hazrat Ali after the Prophet's death. Hazrat Abu Bakr was rightly chosen by the majority of people at Saqifa, despite some minor disagreements. However, I believe that involving Hazrat Ali in the process would have been ideal. Even so, this does not change much, especially since Hazrat Ali reconciled with Hazrat Abu Bakr after six months and later shared a strong bond with him.
- I also believe there was nothing wrong with the selection of each Caliph before Hazrat Ali, as that was how the political system operated at the time. It seems excessive to criticize and question the integrity of the Caliphs, especially considering they enjoyed the Prophet’s trust and Hazrat Ali maintained a very good relationship with each of them throughout their 25-year tenure. If they were as evil as some Shia portray—going so far as to label Hazrat Umar the murderer of Hazrat Fatima—why would Hazrat Ali remain loyal to such individuals? In my opinion, most of these claims are fabricated and stem from the personal bias of historians belonging to the Shia sect.
- The death of Hazrat Usman and the succession of Hazrat Ali may appear controversial at first glance, although I personally do not question Hazrat Ali's integrity. If a Prime Minister of a country is assassinated by a rebellious group from the military, and that group nominates or supports the next Prime Minister, it undoubtedly sends a wrong signal to the outside world. However, I believe Hazrat Ali's intentions were sincere and his heart was in the right place. At the same time, I also think Hazrat Ayesha and Hazrat Muawiyah were justified in their demand for Qisas (retribution) for the murder of Hazrat Usman, which, in my opinion, was a very reasonable demand.
- I have some reservations about the role of Hazrat Muawiyah, particularly regarding the widespread criticism and cursing of Hazrat Ali that occurred during his rule, especially in regions under his strong control. Additionally, his introduction of dynastic politics raises concerns, as it not only went against the established practice of consultation with tribes and leaders before appointing a successor but also violated the peace treaty he had signed with Hazrat Hasan. While his rule is widely regarded as beneficial for the expansion and stability of Islam, there are certain actions that could lead one to question his loyalty and intentions. However, as with every Sahabi, I choose not to question his intentions and prefer to assume that his heart was in the right place.
- The tragedy of Karbala is undoubtedly one of the saddest incidents in Islamic history. Yazid, driven by his lust for power and his desire to secure Bay'ah from the Ahlul Bayt, created a situation that led to the massacre of the family of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). The details of the incident are harrowing and evoke deep anger over what the ruler allowed to happen to the Prophet's family for political motives. In this incident, I tend to agree with the Shia perspective and hold Yazid responsible, even though many Sunnis argue that it was the governor who carried out the atrocities without direct orders from Yazid. However, as a ruler, Yazid bore full responsibility for what transpired under his leadership, whether or not he gave explicit commands. The insult and humiliation faced by the women captives like Hazrat Zainab, including being paraded through the streets of Kufa, only further tarnish Yazid's position. This act of pure evil, inflicted on the family of the Prophet within just 50 years of his death, remains a stain on Islamic history and a deeply painful chapter for all Muslims.


In conclusion, if Shia and Sunni perspectives were placed on a scale from 1 to 100, with 1 being Sunni and 100 being Shia, I would position myself closer to the Sunni side, perhaps around 30. I do not align with the extremes of either side. However, I feel that the Shia version of history often includes self-created narratives based on the assumption that Hazrat Ali was more deserving and that the Prophet explicitly wanted him to succeed, despite a lack of conclusive evidence to support this claim.

I also don’t agree with the notion that being part of the Ahlul Bayt automatically grants additional rights, particularly in political matters after the Prophet’s death. Shia, who emphasize respect for the Ahlul Bayt, often overlook the fact that the Prophet’s family includes his wives, not just his daughter and her husband. This makes Hazrat Ayesha as deserving of respect as any other member of the Ahlul Bayt.

The one area where I fully agree with the Shia perspective is on the tragedy of Karbala and Yazid's responsibility for it. However, will I mourn and beat myself every year over it? Probably not. Islam is about the Holy Quran and the Prophet, and everyone else after him is secondary. I don’t buy into the argument of one figure being inherently superior to another, so it is perfectly acceptable to agree or disagree with anyone—including the Caliphs, Hazrat Muawiyah, or Hazrat Ali—as long as it is done with respect for their personalities and contributions.

I genuinely hope and wish that these two sects can learn to coexist peacefully. The world, especially regions like Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, and Iraq, would be a much better place if this longstanding division were bridged.
