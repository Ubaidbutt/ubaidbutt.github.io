title: "My failure coping mechanism"
categories: [rants]

Let me start with this: there is nothing good about failure, and I don’t care what any motivational speaker or social media guru has to say about it. Failure is the worst feeling in the world. Everything else that you hear about the benefits of failure is just a coping mechanism to help you feel better and move on. I don’t disagree with this approach, but it does not work for me. I am extremely bad at taking failures, even if it's losing a board game with friends, failing a driving theory exam, losing a friendly Hackathon competition in the company, or something else. I cannot laugh or be the positive guy after losing because there are a million things going on in my head at that time—what I could have done better, things I could have avoided, mistakes I made, things I overlooked, including imagining how success would have looked if I didn’t mess up, etc. There is just too much happening in my head to be cheering and being positive. I take my time; I need to go back, sit with myself, go through all the thoughts in my mind, figure out exactly what I did wrong, and plan the next actions before I can come back to a normal state gradually. There are people who are very good at handling failures and can let them go easily. I admire them in their own way, but I set too high of standards for myself to treat any kind of failure casually.
