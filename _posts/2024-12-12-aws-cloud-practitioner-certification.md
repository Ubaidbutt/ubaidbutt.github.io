I am writing this post after passing the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam to document how I prepared for it and what helped me clear it. Below are some points, in no particular order, explaining my motivation for the exam, my preparation, and some tips that helped me pass.

## Motivation
I had been considering pursuing some AWS certifications as part of my yearly goals. Additionally, given the current dry job market, I felt that having extra credentials in the form of certifications would be a valuable way to enhance my marketability for the future. Most importantly, I wanted to deepen my understanding of the AWS ecosystem. Having worked with AWS for three years, I often felt there was something missing, and certifications seemed like a great way to assess my experience and knowledge of AWS while identifying areas for improvement moving forward. 

## Preparation
- The first video I came across for this certification exam was from FreeCodeCamp [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NhDYbskXRgc&t=13205s). It gave me a lot of confidence, especially after seeing the length of the video and reading comments from people who praised the course and mentioned how it helped them pass the exam. Although I didn’t watch the entire video—primarily because it felt too basic for someone like me with considerable AWS experience—it’s an excellent starting point if you’re new to cloud computing or AWS.

- The best resource for my learning and exam preparation was this free course on AWS Skill Builder [here](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/134/play/136404/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials). This course covers many of the exam topics, but what stood out for me was how it helps you understand the concepts on a deeper level while also preparing you for the exam. I highly recommend this course.

- I also relied heavily on ChatGPT by using prompts like, "List all the AWS services related to <network, security, compute, storage> and briefly describe their use cases in 2-3 lines." Additionally, I had ChatGPT generate questions on exam topics to test my knowledge. It’s incredibly useful because you can ask ChatGPT to adjust the difficulty level—making it easier or more challenging—and focus on specific topics. You can even request creative or funny ways to remember which service is used for a particular use case. I highly recommend giving it a try!

- I used the free exam dumps from ExamTopics to practice and prepare for the exam. You can find them [here](https://www.examtopics.com/exams/amazon/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02/view/1/). Another useful website for practising exam question is [here](https://free-braindumps.com/amazon/free-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-braindumps.html?p=1)

## Final thoughts
- The AWS Cloud Practitioner exam is a foundational certification that focuses on the overall AWS ecosystem of services. It’s more about breadth than depth, meaning you should know which AWS services exist and their use cases, rather than the specific configuration options for individual services.
- Based on my experience and what I’ve read, the most important topics to focus on are: the benefits of cloud adoption, the Shared Responsibility Model, EC2 instances and their pricing plans, S3, AWS IAM, AWS Organizations, the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and its perspectives, the AWS Well-Architected Framework, AWS databases (RDS, Aurora), network services (AWS Direct Connect, PrivateLink), VPC, subnets, network ACLs, and AWS Support plans. Having a solid understanding of these topics significantly increases your chances of passing the exam.
- My final advice is to go ahead and book the exam instead of getting stuck in an endless loop of preparation and waiting to feel "ready." I booked my exam date first and then started preparing, which kept me committed. As mentioned earlier, it’s not a very difficult exam, especially if you use AWS regularly in your daily work. A few weeks of preparation should be more than enough, so just go for it!
