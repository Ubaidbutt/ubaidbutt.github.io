# Introduction
Goodbyes are never easy, especially for someone like me who forms deep emotional connections with the company, the product, and, most importantly, the people I work with. Perhaps it’s because I’ve always been fortunate to work alongside kind and supportive individuals.

I started my career in 2018 and have resigned three times since then. Each instance has been a bittersweet and difficult phase to navigate. While the reasons for each change have varied, the process has consistently been a significant challenge for me.

I am going to share the stories of my resignations, detailing what I was doing, why I decided to resign, and how each event unfolded.

# AlphaBOLD

Just like your first love, your first company always holds a special place in your heart, and the same is true for me with AlphaBOLD. It was the company where I began my career, joining as a graduate engineer in a newly established AI and IoT department alongside just my engineering manager. AlphaBOLD, primarily a CRM consultancy, had launched the AI and IoT department to develop innovative products and tap into its existing enterprise customer base.

During my nearly three years at AlphaBOLD, I wore many hats. I worked on everything from building PoCs to MVPs related to ML and IoT, demoing solutions to potential customers, gathering feedback, iterating on those solutions, and eventually acquiring customers. It was a rollercoaster ride where I learned to navigate challenges independently—designing solutions, pitching them, building a team, and ultimately delivering products to customers.

Everything was going well—I was doing meaningful work, loved my teammates, and had an inspiring engineering manager with whom I shared a great bond. However, I realized that I had grown too comfortable climbing the corporate ladder, settling for small, incremental progress in terms of remuneration and overall career growth. This comfort zone began to hold me back.

I also noticed that I wasn’t learning as much as some of my peers—whether on LinkedIn or among my batchmates. The company remained primarily a Dynamics 365 consultancy, with the AI and IoT department now consisting of just four engineers. As a result, the quality of team collaboration, processes, and overall learning was limited. While this environment was fine when I was a fresh graduate transitioning from university, after three years, it began to feel stagnant.

One challenge I began to notice, particularly when working in a consultancy company, was the dynamic of serving a client who isn’t truly the end customer of the product, leaving you with very little freedom to own or shape the product. This often led to a heavy focus on meeting client demands, sometimes at the expense of quality, learning, and the opportunity to work on interesting, innovative projects. This is especially true for consultancy companies in their early stages with a limited client base, where you end up working on whatever is available rather than what could be more engaging or rewarding. 

Over time, I concluded that all work eventually revolves around a product in some form. Even in consultancy, you often find yourself serving a product company indirectly. So, why not cut out the middleman and work directly for a product company? It offers the chance to own product features, take on meaningful responsibilities, and be closer to the end customers, which ultimately feels far more fulfilling.

It was a time when developers were in high demand during covid, with plenty of opportunities available. I was also eager to aim higher by applying for positions abroad, as that had always been my ultimate goal—to work internationally, gain more exposure, and, of course, earn a better income. These factors combined influenced my decision to start exploring opportunities, both within Pakistan and abroad, with a particular focus on joining a product company.
