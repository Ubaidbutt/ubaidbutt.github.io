Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) decided to hold a long march and stage a protest at D-Chowk, Islamabad, on November 24, demanding the release of their leader, who has been in jail for the past two years. Below are my observations and opinions on how the situation unfolded.

### Why shouldn't PTI protest?
My question to anyone questioning the right to protest is: why should they not protest? There have been serious allegations of election rigging this year. The election commission and other judicial institutions aren't making progress on the reported irregularities. The reserved seats aren't being allotted to the deserving party, and on top of all this, you are abducting lawmakers to quite literally force them to make amendments to change the judicial structure, fearing the next chief justice might come hard on you. You have jailed the leader even though most of the cases against him have been dismissed in court, but you are using legal loopholes to file hundreds of FIRs to keep him in jail illegally. What options have you left for them but to protest? 

### The notion of peaceful protest
There is no denying that protests should be peaceful, but the responsibility for ensuring that lies with the government, not the protesters. How can a protest be peaceful when you are issuing death threats, both directly and through various DPOs on social media, warning that you will not let them enter the capital? How can a protest be peaceful when you deploy heavy forces on every route to block incoming protesters? How can it be peaceful when you shut down the country, motorways, internet, and prepare for a confrontation with the protesters? The responsibility for a peaceful protest rests with the administration. How can a peaceful protest take place when the police block the protesters' way, stop them in their tracks, and welcome them with tear gas and rubber bullets? What do you expect from the protesters—to offer you flowers while you fire shells at them? Of course, they will resist, and your notion of a peaceful protest will be shattered. If anyone is responsible for this chaotic protest, it is the government and those pulling the strings behind them—not PTI or its supporters.

### State brutality or a massacre?
I just googled the definition of a massacre, and this is what Wikipedia says:
"A massacre is an event involving the killing of people who are not engaged in hostilities or are defenseless. It is generally used to describe a targeted killing of civilians en masse by an armed group or person."

There is a good chance that PTI and its social media supporters are exaggerating the number of deaths, but how does that change the fact that there was indeed a massacre that night at D-Chowk? Credible sources, including reports from doctors, confirm that multiple people were brought in with gunshot wounds—some were dead, while others were seriously injured. Who was firing these bullets? How can we ensure a fair and transparent inquiry when the state is actively interfering, going into hospitals, and suppressing details to prevent leaks?

If no bullets were fired and no bloodshed occurred, what’s the point of this cover-up? The reality is that people died—several of them. I don’t know the exact number, and frankly, it doesn’t matter. Whether 15 or 150 people died, it remains one of the most brutal actions the state has taken. Now, is that just state brutality or a massacre. I'll leave it up to you to decide that but one thing is for sure that every sane minded person should be condemning the government for this whether you believe this was a massacre or not.

### Will PTI bring a revolution?
PTI is riding high on Imran Khan's popularity, hoping to ignite a revolution similar to the one recently seen in Bangladesh. However, this is nothing short of living in a fool's paradise. Imran Khan undoubtedly has a significant support base across Pakistan, spanning all regions and social classes. It’s fair to say that he is currently the most important political leader in the country. However, expecting people to come out and lay down their lives for him is an unrealistic expectation.

Revolutions are never led by political leaders or parties alone, nor are they sparked solely to free a political leader. Revolutions demand much more than that. Unfortunately, PTI, in its current state—with divided leadership and internal politics—lacks the grassroots solutions to the systemic issues that could inspire a true revolution. You cannot bring about a revolution simply to topple the government and replace it within the same flawed framework, especially when the current government is widely seen as a puppet, with everyone aware of who truly controls this hybrid regime in Pakistan.

Revolutions require grassroots struggle, a clear fight against the real enemy, and an open challenge to the status quo. They demand a concrete alternative to the current system, something PTI has yet to provide. Popular support and millions of followers alone are not enough to spark a revolution—it takes much more than that.


### Ending notes
I would like to conclude this with words from a facebook page that I follow which closely resembles my political opinion:

"There is only one political side in intellectual honesty of Pakistan and that is anti-establishment. Be it neo. Be it pseudo. Be it for the time being. Be it impotent. Be it anyway. It is the only side. When Nawaz named names in Gujranwala, we were on his side - or he jumped on our side. Even knowing that this man would default on the first wink of the master. And he did. 
Now, another pawn of his time, is naming names. And we are on his side. As long as he stays, we stay. When he will default, he will switch. Our side will remain ours. Till death of martial law. Simple as that. Take them by the balls. Even for a second or two. Because that's the only side and anyone on this side on any given day, is my side. Our side. "
