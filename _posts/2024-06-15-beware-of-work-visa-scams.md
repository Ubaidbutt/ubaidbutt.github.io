## The problem
The purpose of writing this blog is to address one common question that my friends and I keep getting from people and acquaintances in Pakistan. Everyone back home seems to be finding a way to leave the country, which is understandable given the circumstances. However, people, in their desperation to leave the country, come across so many scams or not-so-legit ways that can end up costing them their life savings. One such way is people telling me that they have a friend or an agent or anyone who is giving them a work visa for a country like (Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Australia) for an X amount. This amount is usually insane, like 50-60 lacs, and in some cases even more. What is the reality of this work visa?

## Skilled Migration and work visas
Every developed country has a mechanism to offer work visas to people from other countries, but these work visas are for high-skilled jobs. For example, the Netherlands has a work visa category called High Skilled Migrant (HSM), which aims to attract people outside the EU to come and work in the Netherlands if they have some high in-demand skills like software engineers, scientific researchers, etc. It is important to note that most of these work visas are for people having some “high-skilled” profession. Some countries might consider a physician a high-skilled profession, while other countries might not, depending on the demand and supply of these professions in the country. Let me make it simple for you: If you don’t have at least a Bachelor’s degree OR a good amount of work experience in a high in-demand skill like software engineering or something similar, you won’t be eligible for this visa category.

The legitimate process of obtaining a work visa is that you get a job offer from a company in that country. You apply for a job at that company, go through the interview process, and get selected for the role. The company will then give you a valid offer letter stating your role, salary, and other details. In most cases, the company will apply for your work visa on your behalf, and once the visa is approved, you can go to the embassy and get a stamp on your passport. In some cases, a company might only give you an offer letter and ask you to apply for a work visa yourself. This is possible, but 99% of reputable companies will not ask you to do this. In the Netherlands, for example, even if you get a job offer from a company, you cannot apply for a work visa yourself. Only the company in the Netherlands can apply for your work visa on your behalf.

## Work visa scam
Now, let’s come to the original point of your agent giving you a work visa. How does this happen? The agent will have a friend or acquaintance in the host country, let’s say the Netherlands, and the friend will have a registered company there with a license to hire foreign skilled workers. They will give you a job from that “fake” company and apply for your work visa. Once your work visa is obtained, you can come to the country just like a normal person would.

Coming to the country is one thing, but what will you do next because you don’t have a job? In most cases, the “fake” company will have to pay your monthly income tax to the government to show that you are actually working, and that money may also be taken from you. You have to go and find a job in a “real” company that can sponsor your work visa. Any real company will only hire you if you have some in-demand skills, which brings us back to our original point that if you had the right skills, you could have gotten this job from your home country as well.

The work visa from your agent is just a mechanism to bypass the system and bring you to the country, and that’s all. You end up paying 50-60 lacs just to enter the country without a job and without any support. Not to forget that if the government figures out after a year or two that the company was fake, you can be in trouble even if you have already settled in the country and found a new job in a real company.

## Conclusion
The crux of the matter is that the only legitimate work visa is the one you get directly from a company in that country. To get a work visa from a company directly, you need skills that the companies are looking for. You need to apply for jobs on LinkedIn and other job portals, hopefully get an interview call, go through the interview process, and secure a real job with the company. This is what I did as well to find a job and come to the Netherlands.
