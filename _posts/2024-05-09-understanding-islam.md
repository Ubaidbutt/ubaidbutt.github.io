For the past few weeks, my interest in Islam has been growing a lot, thanks to Ghamidi Sahab's videos on YouTube. I always heard of him as the liberal Molvi who finds ways in Islam for liberal people to continue their liberal ways of life. ðŸ˜ƒ 

When I started listening to him, I began to admire his style of communication, the way he looks at religion and Islam, and especially how he contextualizes Islam instead of blindly following it without understanding. I watched his videos on a variety of topics, mainly around pardah, marriage as an institution, roles and responsibilities of husbands and wives, the existence of God, and more. After watching his videos, I became very interested in knowing the truth about Islam because the Islam he portrays is very different from what I and most of us are used to while living in Pakistan. I had this desire in me to figure out the "real" Islam.

I want to study Islam as a student, and my idea is to just read the holy book itself and see how it goes. We donâ€™t need to complicate it. Letâ€™s just pick up a decent copy of the book in a language I understand and read it like I read so many other books. I ordered "The Clear Quran," an English translation of the Quran by Mustafa Khattab. I am going to try to read the book and document my understanding of it on this blog as I progress in this journey.

There is already a lot of confusion and complications, like which translation to pick because apparently there are countless English translations, and each has its supporters and backers. Furthermore, a translation can never be exactly the same as the original Quran because itâ€™s a translation after all. But my goal is simple: just pick up the book and read it. Try to understand it and make sense of it without thinking too much about the ifs and else's. Letâ€™s first read one translation and see what I understand, and then I can always read more and extend my knowledge.
