<h2 style="text-align: left;">Dreams and struggles</h2>
I was born and raised in a lower-class family in a small town in Sialkot and spent the first 17 years of my life there, attending public schools and later a private college on a merit-based scholarship. Our household was managed by our mother, who did various odd jobs to make just enough to put food on the table. The idea of going to another city for higher education was a foreign concept given our circumstances and resources, but I dared to dream primarily because I was tired of family conflicts and wanted to escape.

I started applying to universities and eventually got admitted to one of the top-ranked universities in the capital city, Islamabad. Then came the hard part: How would we manage the fee for the first semester? Even though it wasnâ€™t a huge amount (70k PKR), at that time, for my mother, it was an enormous challenge. I am sure she didnâ€™t even earn 70k in an entire year, so it was a daunting task and something she would have to manage every semester (6 months) for the next four years.

My mother was a courageous woman, the bravest I have ever known, and I am not being biased. Against all odds and knowing it would be a monumental challenge to fund my education for the next four years, she allowed me to pursue my dream. How did she manage the money? Like every dedicated mother would for the dream of her child. She sold her jewelry, worked tirelessly, took out loans, and when things got tough, she even sold half of our house to ensure I could complete my education. My degree is 1% mine and 99% my motherâ€™s, for her hard work, determination, and unwavering willpower to not give up on her childâ€™s dreams.

After my graduation, I found myself searching for a job because I knew my family relied on it. My mother had spent everything she had on my university fees and living expenses over the past four years. I remember when she sent me the fee for the last semester; her exact words were, "This is all I have, Ubaid. I am counting on you now" (translated from my native language).

The expectations were high back home because, according to them, when someone graduates from a good university, they immediately get a good job and start earning a lot of money, like in the movies. No? We all know thatâ€™s not how it is, and I realized it when I was about to graduate. The stakes were as high as they could get. I needed a job, and I needed it badly.

I had been staying in the capital city, Islamabad, for the past four years, and it had a pretty good IT industry. I also had my friends around and was comfortable in the city, so I started applying for jobs. My goal was to find a job here, and I had no intentions of moving to other big cities. The job search was the most difficult phase of my life. I remember sending messages on LinkedIn, sending CVs, applying on job portals like Rozee.pk, and more, but almost to no avail because I didnâ€™t receive a single interview call in the first two months.

I once checked my sent email messages and realized that I had sent more than 200 emails to various recruiters. Applications on different platforms such as Glassdoor, Rozee.pk, and LinkedIn are not included in this. I was sending messages on LinkedIn to everyone, asking for help, and some of them seemed very desperate. I have attached a few for you to read:

<h2 style="text-align: left;">Destiny and job</h2>
After considerable effort in improving my CV, learning new things, and enhancing my communication skills, I finally got an interview call and subsequently an offer letter from the Pakistan Air Force as a graduate software engineer. The offer letter was a huge deal because, first, I got a job and I desperately needed it; secondly, it was in Islamabad; and thirdly, it was for the Pakistan Air Force. If you come from Pakistan, you know how big of a flex it is to work for our beloved armed forces. (I didnâ€™t think like that)

The salary, however, was 35k/month, which is hardly enough to make ends meet while living in Islamabad and supporting my family back home. Still, I was happy because at least I had a job in the city I wanted, surrounded by people I loved. The joining date was months away because the background check and bureaucratic process were lengthy, so I kept applying for new positions. This led to an interview call from a startup in Lahore. After a few initial interviews, they invited me for an in-person interview in Lahore. I never wanted to change cities and work in Lahore, but Iâ€™m not sure why I still paid 2000 PKR and traveled 5 hours one way for that one interview with that company.

When they asked me about my salary expectations, I requested 50k thinking that I had asked for a very high amount and would most likely be rejected ðŸ˜‚. After a few days, I received an offer from the company with the salary I had requested. By the way, my manager later told me after I joined that I had asked for a much lower salary because they were willing to offer up to 70k if I had asked for it.

Nevertheless, I faced a tough decision. Lahore was closer to my hometown, had a bigger IT industry with more career opportunities, and the company was a proper IT startup rather than a government-run institution like the PAF (Pakistan Air Force). All logic suggested I should choose Lahore, but I was determined to stay in Islamabad because it had become my comfort zone. So, I decided to decline the new offer from Lahore.

However, the background check for the PAF job was taking too long, so I decided to join the new company in Lahore for just a month to earn the 50k, as I needed money at that time. I went to Lahore without any transportation or living arrangements. I stayed with my cousin in his hostel (15 km away) for the first week and commuted to work using Uber Bike. I was convinced that I will leave the company after receiving my first salary.

On my first day at the job, I entered a spacious open floor where approximately 20 individuals were diligently at work. I was welcomed by my manager with a big smile on his face. He proved to be the best manager for a youngster like me, I loved my interactions with him and got to learn so much from him. He was talkative, yet very knowledgeable, so he walked me through his plans for the new AI & IoT department that he was leading, and for which I was hired.

The initial days went smoothly, and I developed a fondness for the people, particularly my manager. However, I knew I had to go back, so I began complaining to my manager about not having a place to stay. Guess what? He spoke with some other colleagues in the company who had a spare bed space available in their apartment, solving my housing problem at a very reasonable cost. Additionally, my colleagues requested that I not bring a bike because they didnâ€™t have parking space available, and they offered me to commute with them since we worked in the same office. Even better because I couldnâ€™t afford a bike at that time.

In a single day, I had my housing and transportation sorted out. After working for a few weeks with the company, I received my first salary. A few days later, I received a call from the PAF stating that I needed to submit some documents for final verification before I could join them.

What should I have done? The plan was to come here for the first month's salary, then return to Islamabad, and join the Pakistan Air Force, live in a city where I was comfortable and had all my friends. But instead, I declined their offer and chose to stay with the startup in Lahore. The reason? I was too hesitant to tell my manager that I was leaving because he had been so supportive. He took me to breakfast and lunches, helped me find a place to stay, and we developed a strong bond after our lengthy conversations about life, politics, and the economy. I just couldnâ€™t muster the courage to tell him that I was leaving. The decision, whether due to a lack of bravery or guilt, turned out to be the single best thing that happened to me in my career.

How do I know that staying in this startup was a better decision and joining Pakistan Airforce in Islamabad wouldâ€™ve been a mistake?

When I declined the offer from PAF, a very close friend of mine got that job, and he worked there for 6 months. Later, he told me that it was not a great place to work because the technology stack was old, you werenâ€™t allowed to use the internet, and there wasnâ€™t enough guidance and the work culture you need in an IT company. I recommended him to this Lahore startup, and he ultimately left that job to work here. The trajectory my career would have taken if I had pursued that path would have been vastly different from what it is today, and I am uncertain if it would have been as fulfilling as the one I chose. Three of my good friends and acquaintances joined PAF, but all of them left within the first year, so yeah, it would have been a disastrous decision.

The next few years in the company were excellent in terms of financial stability and learning opportunities. I managed to support my family, increase my salary rapidly, and, most significantly, acquire experience working in a service-oriented company with diverse clients on cutting-edge technology stacks related to AI and IoT. This experience later helped me make the next big move in my career.
