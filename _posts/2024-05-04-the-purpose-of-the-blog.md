I love to write, and I need a platform to write; hence, this blog. What do I write about? Pretty much everything I feel like writing about. I am a software engineer, so of course, about programming, technology, career advice and corporate life, but also my rants about politics, social issues, and more.

I don't have any expectations from the platform. I am not trying to or intend to sell anything, even in the future. It just serves as a repository for my thoughts, much like my Twitter account. I do, however, set high standards for myself and would like to produce quality content every now and then that helps someone out there in some way because that's the ultimate satisfaction for me in life: knowing that even one person changed his or her life for the better because of me.

On this platform, you can expect to find a young man sharing his life experiences, thought process, and opinions on a range of different topics while growing and adapting to the realities of the world.
