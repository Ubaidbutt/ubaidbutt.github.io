If you are an active Twitter user like myself, it is impossible not to come across a viral tweet on the topic of marriage every second week. People have different opinions on this topic, from when one should marry to whom one should marry, what criteria should be used in choosing a partner, and mixing all of this with criticism of the opposite gender, like gold digging for girls and accusations of being cheaters, or demands for dowry for guys.

I have been part of quite a few Twitter fights over this topic but never got the chance to completely share my perspective on it. Following are just my thoughts on the idea of marriage and most of the rants you usually come across on Twitter.

First things first, marriage is a fundamental human right, and everyone should be completely free to choose whomever they want to marry based on whatever criteria they feel is best for them. Think of marriage like capitalism; you can have any demands for the kind of man or woman you want to marry, and the world will show you whether you are being reasonable about it or not.

If you are a girl, you are free to say that you want a man who has a certain look, a particular height, makes a certain amount of money, comes from a certain family, or even put some specification about the size of his dick, and it's completely fine. Similarly, if you are a man, you are free to say that you want to marry a girl of a certain age (above the legal limit), with specific looks or height, from a particular family background, with certain life goals or experiences, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of this.

You are not going to put a gun to someone's head and force them to marry you. This is why I say to think of marriage as if you are trying to sell yourself for a price, and you can set any price in terms of what you are looking for and see if you can find someone who meets those criteria in the world, and if you do, please go ahead and have a happy married life.

The problem I have seen on Twitter is that modern-day feminists will mock men and use adjectives like "misogynist" when they express a desire to marry a young girl or a girl without any past relationships. On the flip side, typical men will call girls gold diggers when they ask for a substantial haq mehar or want to marry a well-settled guy. Both men and women value different things in life and look for different qualities in their potential partners, and we cannot question or criticize someone for why they find a particular quality important in their future partner.

The actual problem with most Twitter fights about this topic is that people see a tweet about relationships or marriage and evaluate it based on their own personal experiences or those around them. If you are a girl who has been cheated on by a guy or has friends who were manipulated or cheated on by their partners, you might view all men in relationships as cheaters and manipulators. Similarly, if you are a man who was rejected by his girlfriend for a well-settled guy, you might always view all girls in relationships as gold diggers.

Marriage is arguably one of the most important decisions of your life, one that will impact you the most. Hence, you should be completely free to carefully consider it and choose whomever you see fit based on whatever factors you feel are right. It's essential to take your time, discuss everything in granular detail before you finally decide to marry someone. Consider aspects such as how the family will be run, who will be the head of the family, who is responsible for finances and household chores, whether responsibilities will be divided equally, the presence of gender roles, religious values, child-rearing practices, decisions regarding one partner leaving their career for children, who that would be, and who will have the final say in decisions, among other things. Sort out all these aspects before marriage to ensure that both partners understand each other well enough before saying, "Qabool hai, Qabool hai, Qabool hai."

Whatâ€™s the conclusion here? Let people be free in terms of what they want to have in their future partner; after all, they will be living with the results of it, whether good or bad. You should focus on what you want in your partner and look to find someone who can match that.
