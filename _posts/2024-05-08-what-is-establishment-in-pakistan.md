We often hear the word "establishment" in Pakistani politics, usually linked to the military and intelligence agencies. But is that all it means? Not really. The idea of the establishment is more complicated. While the military is a big part of it, there are other players too. Think of it as a social phenomenon.

Here's an example to explain. Imagine you're a 20-year-old student from a middle-class family, studying at NUST. You've got friends at university, like one whose dad is a Major General, another whose sibling is a judge, and maybe one with a brother-in-law who's a cop. 

Now, say you get into a fight at a coffee shop, and your friends jump in, making things worse. The other guys go and file a police complaint against you. Who do you call for help? Probably your friend with the cop connection.

They might try to sort things out, making the other side drop the complaint. If that doesn't work, you might go to your friend with the judge in the family. A word from them could fix it. If it ends up in court, the judge might talk to another judge to help you out.

During all this, you might not even think you did anything wrong. You just got into a fight because someone was rude to you. Asking your friend for help seems natural, and they probably think they're doing the right thing by helping you out.

The concept of the establishment operates much like this. Imagine a politician whose brother is married into a family with deep connections to the army, including relatives in high positions. These officers are also married into influential business families, with significant interests in sectors like agriculture and real estate. They hold considerable sway in funding political campaigns. 

Additionally, some of your friends work in intelligence agencies like the ISI and could help appoint a bureaucratic friend of yours as the head of NAB (National Accountability Bureau). It's a chain of influence, and you can see how things unfold from there.

The Establishment is like a big social network of people who have power in the system. We're all part of our own establishment in many ways. We use our connections to protect ourselves, our families, and our friends, and to help ourselves out whenever we can, most of the time regardless of any ethics and morality. 

Think of yourself, would you not use your influence in the bureaucracy if you could figure out where the government is thinking about starting the next motorway so you could buy the nearby land and earn a profit by later selling it?

Would you not use your influence in police or FIA to get your brother out of trouble for a harassement case against him?


The political and military establishment that you hear in the news does the same thing but on a higher level with many complications and a lot more consequences for us as the general public and the country as a whole.


If you understand the establishment, how would you reduce its influence?

Firstly, we need to fix our bureaucratic system to make it automated, centralized, and transparent, such that there is no room to hijack it even if one desires to do so. Consider how to design a police system in a way where a police officer cannot act outside of the established processes, even if they wish to. How can we reform our judicial system to make it so transparent that it becomes impossible for lawyers, judges, and everyone in between to engage in corruption? The system should be structured to compel people to abide by the rules and the law.

However, fixing the system alone will not suffice because a significant component of any system is its people, and if they are morally corrupt, no system will be adequate. We need to educate the younger generation to be morally upright. We need to instill morality in them so that they have the courage to denounce wrongdoing regardless of who perpetrates it. We need individuals who will not seek ways to exploit the system to protect their friends or relatives.

It is the combination of these two approaches that I believe offers any chance of gaining control over the influence of the establishment in our country.
