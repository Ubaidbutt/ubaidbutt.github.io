title: "What makes a software engineer great?"
categories: [technology, career]

I have had the chance to work with some great software engineers in my short career of 6 years. They have inspired me with their talent, skillset, and personalities, and motivated me to become a better software engineer myself. However, the real question that I want to answer is: what makes a software engineer truly great?

I am going to list some qualities that I have encountered and observed in engineers who inspired me. These are the qualities I am striving for in my career, as I believe they will make me great, at least in my opinion

## Technically strong 
It’s obvious because you cannot become a great software engineer with a mediocre skillset. You have to be the absolute best in terms of your technical skills to stand out from the crowd. If you are a backend engineer, you should really be at the top of your game in focused areas like APIs, integrations, cloud infrastructure, including a programming language, frameworks, and tooling around a particular technology stack. People are going to look up to you to fix their issues, and you cannot do that without all of this. This point also includes having a great understanding of the fundamentals of programming, from data structures to algorithms, operating systems, database concepts, and things like Git. Imagine a junior coming to you after he/she messed up a Git branch, and now you don’t know how to figure the mess out. Will they be inspired by you? I don’t think so. The baseline is that your code pull requests should scream that you are a great software engineer. When someone comes to you for help, they should go back thinking that this man really has deep understanding of things. When some asks for an opinion or suggestion on a technical topic, they should see the reasoning and knowledge from your conversation.

## Exceptional communication skills
Once you have the necessary technical skills, your communication and collaboration skills become extremely important. You can have all the knowledge and technical skills, but if you don’t master the way to effectively convey that to others, your technical skills alone won’t do much for you. Having good communication skills means being able to guide a junior, participate in internal and external meetings, present your ideas concisely during design discussions, negotiate timelines with your product owner and manager, and more. BTW, writing skills are also included in communication skills.

## No show-off
All the good engineers I have seen were never showoffs. In fact, they were the complete opposite. They never directly showed off or even tried in any way to gain the limelight unnecessarily. Their work speaks for them, and people around them speak for them, but they don’t engage in self-praise because it’s cringy and it diminishes their credibility. You won’t see them in every retro telling you how many people they have helped or how they were always overworked. You will never hear them boasting about how much they know or that everybody comes to them for help. If they are overworked, you will see them finding great ways to communicate that, but they never resort to being crybabies or attention seekers in any way.

## Genuinely good people
Great software engineers are also great people, and you can see that when you work with them in a team. They are supportive, trustworthy, and empathetic as teammates and as humans. They are almost always people with zero ego, always willing to help others and push them forward. In my experience, I have seen them to be really knowledgeable about general topics, including sports, science, politics, religion, and more.


## Conclusion
I would like to mention two people I have worked with who have truly inspired me with their skills:

- Mahdi Pourziaei from Fashion Cloud: He was hands down the most talented engineer I have worked with so far in my career.
- Fahad Heylaal from DAZN: Although I didn’t directly work with him in the team, he was the architect for our team and possesses the best communication skills I have seen from an engineer.

Both of them may not know this, but if you guys are reading this, thank you for inspiring me.
