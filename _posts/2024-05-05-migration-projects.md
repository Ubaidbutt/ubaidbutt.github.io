title: "Should you work on migration projects as a software engineer? Are they rewarding or a waste of your time and skills?"

I am currently working on a migration project to transition some legacy services from Java to the new stack of NodeJS & TypeScript with AWS serverless. I have been having mixed thoughts about working on a project like this and wanted to share my thoughts here.

Let’s be honest, migration projects are dull and not rewarding for the most part. You are not building anything; in fact, the users of the application won’t even feel the difference. The business would add a one-liner at the year-end review saying that you have successfully migrated XYZ service to the new stack.

The biggest motivation for us engineers (after money) is to know that we are building something that will be used by people, or if you are working in a platform team like myself, you build stuff that will be used by other engineers. In most cases, you are building new stuff, but that’s not the case with migration projects. Not working on new features makes you feel like you are not growing or being useful for the business.

You have to deal with tricky people situations because you will be spending a lot of time with the legacy team to find and document information about the existing services and functionality, and that is a very tricky situation. Why? You are eventually migrating something that will put them out of business, so it is not as easy as it looks.

I was getting demotivated thinking about all this, but I am someone who likes to create something positive out of difficult situations, and after doing some deep thinking, I did think about all the good things migration projects like this can bring to you.

The first thing you learn is the art of communication and collaboration. As mentioned, you have to talk to so many different people, mostly from the legacy team, to extract information and understand the existing functionality. You have to talk to your product owner and other team members to plan the migration. It can also involve collaborating with other senior engineers and architects to finalize the design and architecture of the new system. You write a lot of documentation to document the existing functionality but also design documentation for the new system. In my case, I was also creating user stories for each individual task required to complete the migration project. You may not understand it, but this is a huge skill set to have in your toolbox when you are thinking to grow in your career.

You can also improve your skills in the new target stack and make use of this project to enhance your understanding of the programming language, framework, libraries, etc. You can follow best practices, do things the right way, write tests, etc. You will, of course, have to negotiate and get your time from the PO and management, but this is achievable if you have good communication.

You can also use this opportunity to strengthen your weak or not so strong skill areas. Imagine, you are a backend engineer but you are not very proficient in DevOps and cloud technology. You can involve yourself more in these areas and work on user stories to set up CI/CD pipelines or tasks related to setting up infrastructure.

In conclusion, migration projects are boring especially if you are a senior engineer who is very proficient in the target stack already and have done these kinds of projects in the past. However, if you are a mid to senior-level engineer who still needs to learn a lot in the new target stack, migration projects can serve as a great opportunity for you to get hands-on experience in different technologies in the new target stack and get better in the areas where you need more work along with improving your communication and collaboration skills.
